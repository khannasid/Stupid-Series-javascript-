    designed to work in an asynchronous environment.

    so that nodemon will start running with "npm start" command!!
    
4. Routing refers to how an application's endpoints (URIs) respond
    to client requests. We can define routing using methods of the Express app object

    to handle POST requests.

5. Socket.io is a JavaScript library for realtime web applications. It 
    enables realtime, bi-directional communication between web clients and 
    server. It has two parts: a Client-Side library that runs in the browser and 
    a Server-Side library for Node.js. 

6. To work with Socket.io we also need an HTTP package.
